I have always liked to fight for what I want and I have encountered many obstacles that I could not knock down, stones that made me trip and people that made it difficult for me to pass.
I have my faults, like everyone. I'm not perfect, there is no one who is. It's my fault that sometimes I measure my words too much and fail to say what I really think. Bad taste and ill-timed jokes fail me. That stubbornness of mine fails me. It fails me that, sometimes, I don't know when is the right time to say ""I'm sorry"" and other times I don't even dare or it doesn't come out of me. And many other things...
I always tend to value myself less than what I'm really worth for fear that I'll think something uncertain. I'm somewhat insecure.

With you there are plenty of wishes,
I don't ask for more because you are everything I long for,
and if it's with you I'll stay

It is a privilege to have you in my life,
That just seeing you makes my day,
And forever, I want to have you.

because being together,
the universe will be in favor
and everything will be perfect.

I will be a fan of your body and the passion you give me.
It will be a pleasure to have you every day in my calendar.

I walked many years on the spiritual paths of the Native American (the Red Road) and was a ?€?spirit runner?€? loving to participate in Spirit Runs running trails and at one in the beauty of creation and with the animals. I will always treasure the lessons I learned during those years, lessons which gave me a deep appreciation for nature, compassion of people and a respect and love for the many cultures of the world.

I discuss instead of arguing. You're entitled to your feelings and your perspective. I'm sensitive and intuitive... no drama or conflict. I enjoy time alone, but not to the point of being lonely. I prefer to be with someone most of the time.

I love to travel and would love to meet someone who loves to travel as much as I do whether it?€?s a cruise, short weekend trip or a weeklong trip to a romantic place I?€?ve never been to before. I?€?m looking for someone to share my life with. Someone who is as serious as I am about finding the person who may not be perfect but is perfect for me. I?€?m at a point in my life where I have everything I need except for that one special person who is looking for the same things I?€?m looking for. I enjoy most sports, so long as I can still handle that. I?€?m not looking for someone to fall in love with but someone to fall madly and passionately in love with (and vice versa), someone who makes me laugh, share secrets with, call during the busy work-day just to say hi, I?€?m thinking about you, someone who is romantic and affectionate, someone to spend quality time with, and someone who is not afraid to express her feelings or show her emotions. There has to be chemistry, mutual attraction and compatibility between us. I?€?m not a mind reader, say what?€?s on your mind instead of holding it in. And if there is a problem, let?€?s meet in the middle and work on it together knowing the importance of open communication and the commitment we have to each other, the realization that our relationship is worth fighting for and doing whatever it takes to keep it going. Miss waking up to someone next to me every morning, someone to read the paper with, someone to get tangled up in the sheets with, and someone to cuddle with next to a warm, cozy fire on a cold, rainy night. I also miss the intimacy and commitment of a monogamous relationship and am ready to try again. I feel that I have a lot to offer. I can be silly and goofy at times but am also honest, sincere, and trustworthy. I want someone who have a good sense of humor, is also silly and goofy at times and knows how to make me laugh.

I maintain a balance between career, family and personal life. I love nature, adventure, sunshine, moonlight, and a good laugh. I?€?m a happy, caring, romantic, passionate person and a loyal friend. I?€?m generally down to earth but appreciate finer things in life.I have a very outgoing personality, but it has been damaged by people who I though cared about me. I am careful now as to who I give my heart to. I love (almost) anything having to do with the outdoors. I dream of a nice walk along a garden path to a lighthouse or a waterfall with an enjoyable companion. I dream of sailing to a glorious island paradise with a jovial friend.I love long walks on the beach, candlelight dinners and am a romantic at heart i?€?m a considerate and caring person who is always willing to go that ?€?extra?€? mile in a relationship?€?and expects the same in return.Sometimes quiet at first meeting, until I get to know somebody. I holding hands, competitng or going out on a quiet trail ride or the beach. My Little Daughter the most important person in my life. You will need to be able to share some sort passion for animals as they are all a big part of my life at this moment and need and depend on me. Beside this I love to go to a soccer game, Nascar, Motorcross and the Drag Races?€?im sort of kid at heart?€?but can dress to the nines for that special occasion. ..
I?€?m a family Oriented man and I cherish my friends, I?€?m casual, most comfortable in my suits, and enjoy going out somewhere special too and getting dressed up. I love to barbecue EVERYTHING if it can be put the grill! I?€?m at ease at a backyard barbecue or a social function and can hold a conversation with just about anyone.
I am looking for a female companion to go on walks,to enjoy the ocean, the lake and the mountains and to share in interesting conversation, someone easy going.My perfect match would be someone who I can have a lot of fun with, someone who is outgoing and not afraid to speak their mind. Also respect is important with me I believe that you need to give respect to recieve respect. Another important quality for a relationship in my mind would be to enjoy spending quality time with a special someone.I?€?d like to meet a woman with a great sense of humor who can laugh with me. she?€?ll need to be confident, honest, caring, affectionate and sweet. When we talk on the phone, or in person I would like hear/see the smile and laughter in her voice.
I really love a big-hearted woman. I?€?m not into women who are stuck on ones income or status. I need honesty and dont like liars. I enjoy hearing about how your day went or just snuggling together. Compatibility and trust is a good foundation, but chemistry is the key factor to a great relationship. I am very honest and was raised the old fashion way.I would love to meet someone who shares a passion for something in their lives?€?something they truly enjoy. I feel so blessed to have my passion become my profession. I think that is truely success. To meet someone who has their own interests and passions and is willing to share a life together while having separate interests is very healthy. I have lots of love to offer the right person?€?seems like my judgement hasn?€?t been the best in the past few years. I will try letting someone else lead me in the right direction. Laughter is very important to me?€?it can cure a multitude of woes?€?

65,"New York, or Los Angeles, California, United States",white,artist,widowed,"I am honest. I love to laugh and make others laugh. I?€?m an artist, and enjoy seeing and studying visual arts. I also love my friends and family, the outdoors, witnessing acts of kindness, the human spirit, fly fishing, and the underdog. I am troubled by injustice, the ?€?isms,?€? the direction this country has recently taken, what we?€?re doing to this planet, and the TVs that seem to be everywhere these days.Art and fly fishing are the two hobbies that I?€?m most passionate about; my raisons d?€???tre. I generally work in an oil and gas company but also into mosaic art,I prefer to work from life rather than photos who?€?s details can easily seduce me into tighter painting. I paint mostly people, portraits, and the figure.
I began fishing when I was three years old, and fishing is a part of my DNA. Moving water grabs me at my core, and pulls me towards it. It?€?s primal. But my need to fish is usually satiated by quality rather than quantity. I practice catch-and-release.I think I?€?m reasonable intelligent. I have a Masters degree, and I?€?m the chief financial officer for a state education agency I don?€?t live for my work, but I do enjoy it most of the time.
I like to travel and experience new places and new cultures, but prefer traveling with a partner or alone rather than a tour group. I?€?m a Yankanuck-a dual citizen of the US and Canada. For me, travel doesn?€?t have to be around the globe to be interesting and worthwhile. It?€?s much more about listening, seeing, and engaging a place and its people on their terms rather than on my own.France and the French people hold a special place in my heart. Their food, wine and bread are not to bad either. The first place I fished at age was on the Seine River in Vaux sur Seine, France. I?€?ve returned to France several times and each visit adds to the love I have for this treasure.
Making and eating good food is important to me, and another way to experience other cultures. Cooking for others is also one way I express love. I enjoy wine and wine tours, but my palate is not particularly sophisticated. I enjoy dancing but again, not particularly sophisticated, swing mainly.
So how obvious is it that this is my first profile? Yeah, that?€?s what I thought. Ok, I?€?m tired of starting sentences with ?€?I?€? so I?€?ll leave it here for now.Well, I?€?ve done some editing this morning. I guess we?€?ll see if it?€?s an improvement or not.Let me tell you a little about what I?€?m looking for in a woman. Mind you, my range of acceptable traits is much broader if we are to be just friends. I?€?m looking for an equal partner, lover, friend, and companion. She should be honest, intelligent, considerate of others, willing to be vulnerable, independent, and a woman of substance. I don?€?t need a mother, housekeeper, cook, or laundress.

My biggest hobby is dancing, I think that every person should know the language of body. I like to visit cinema, theater, different shows. I love nature and in summer I enjoy going to the seaside to have a rest,I?€?ve learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them. I?€?ve learned that no matter how much I care, some people just don?€?t care back. I?€?ve learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it. I?€?ve learned that it?€?s not what you have in your life but who you have in your life that counts. I?€?ve learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you?€?d better know something. I?€?ve learned that you shouldn?€?t compare yourself to the best others can do but to the best you can do. I?€?ve learned that it?€?s not what happens to people that?€?s important. It?€?s what they do about it. I?€?ve learned that you can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life. I?€?ve learned that no matter how thin you slice it, there are always two sides. I?€?ve learned that it?€?s taking me a long time to become the person I want to be. I?€?ve learned that it?€?s a lot easier to react than it is to think. I?€?ve learned that you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them. I?€?ve learned that you can keep going long after you think you can?€?t. I?€?ve learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel. I?€?ve learned that either you control your attitude or it controls you. I?€?ve learned that heroes are the people who do what has to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences. I?€?ve learned that learning to forgive takes practice. I?€?ve learned that there are people who love you dearly, but just don?€?t know how to show it. I?€?ve learned that money is a lousy way of keeping score. I?€?ve learned that sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you?€?re down will be the ones to help you get back up. I?€?ve learned that sometimes when I?€?m angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn?€?t give me the right to be cruel. I?€?ve learned that just because someone doesn?€?t love you the way you want them to doesn?€?t mean they don?€?t love you with all they have. I?€?ve learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you?€?ve had and what you?€?ve learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you?€?ve celebrated. I?€?ve learned that you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating, and what a tragedy it would be if they believed it. I?€?ve learned that your family won?€?t always be there for you. It may seem funny, but people you aren?€?t related to can take care of you and love you and teach you to trust people again. Families aren?€?t biological. I?€?ve learned that no matter how good a friend is, they?€?re going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.

As for me, I live to love, to experience the magical feeling that love gives, to give my heart, my soul , my everything. I long to live my life for something worth while{ love }for it is like oxygen, the very essence of life. Much time is wasted on frivolities and trivialities and chasing after the wind and if there?€?s one lesson i have learned in life, it is that u got to make d most of everything for life in itself is never ending and coming to love is what makes life eternal. Indeed, the greatest lesson is to love and be loved. So, i crave that, i want it, i desire it; if for just a moment, then my life wouldn?€?t have been a waste. Life is too short to be chained to an unloving heart and if there?€?s little love anywhere on the planet, i can travel the length to seek and find it. I am young @ heart but puts no barrier to love. I only seek to find the one who appreciates the ?€?little and big things?€? i have to give. So i keep hoping , as i know the best things in life either come too soon or too late{ i pray for soon though} but never @ the time we expect .",1,31-40,United States

-I will be making serious steps towards marriage, not excuses. The same I expect from you.
-I don't cheat or lie neither online nor in real life when I am in official relation and in general. The same I expect from you.
-I won't ask you to send me money. The same I expect from you. If I like to help I will offer.

60,"Bsharri, Lebanon",middle eastern,other,single,"I follow my words and I'm a man of my words.I'm single never married. I'm seeking for a long term relationship that could lead to marriage. I'm cleansed with my own tears for true love, so I will remain pure for evermore. Only great joy or great sorrow can reveal my truth. I look up high to see only the light, and never look down to see my shadow. By true love, I could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light. 
I have a strong personality. I'm self confident, strong willed, romantic, sensual, independent, honest, sincere, upright, patient, persistent, very bold, refined, talented, corageous, valiant, manifold and many sided... I'm very educated and well mannered. I always develop myself and I treat others the way I want them to treat me. I will stay clean, upright, transparent, charitable, and fair to the oppressed, but hard on people oppressors. I'm always patient in pain, strong and above all lowly passions... But I always say: Save me, God, from myself, cleanse me of all my impurities. Forge me in the forge of Your Right...
Otherwise, I'm very fond of music and dance, because dancing give me the chance to express my emotions, and it arouses different feelings in my soul. So I'm very calm in my life, but very crazy in my love. 
I adore Love and Beauty because they are the reflection of God in me. I want to live by kindness which should be the source of every law upon the earth, for kindness is the shadow of God in me. To me, the true great love makes miracles and heals from diseases. It is boundless and has no age. Effectively, I prefer death through happiness of love a thousandfold to life in vain and despair. I prefer to be a dreamer among modest and poor men, than being a rich man among those who are without dreams and desires...
Moreover, by love, my second nature can transform me in one new person. So I must be devoted to love and life, because, what I get out of it depends of what I put into it...
And all my life, I've been searching for the true love, for a face, for a look... I'm perpetually in a state of wandering... searching... my future beloved... It's so easy to find a person to live with, but it's so hard to find the one without whom I can't live.",0,61-70,Lebanon

Communication is important to me and will need to be with the woman I want to spend time with whether dating or getting to know each other. I can be a very romantic and consider myself to be very affectionate. Being loved and being able to love is important.
My dedication to my chosen career gets in when ever i have a new contract to execute in between the year, I?€?m working really hard on trying to find a better balance in life. But I do know how to take time off from time to time, you could say I am getting better at putting first things first, but I know that people in my life take priority over things. But you might have to remind me of that from time to time as I?€?m not perfect and don?€?t expect you to be either.
I know that having that someone special in my life is an important responsibility as well. I do have a deep love for people, a respect for fellow citizens of the earth, and making commitments to those I care and love. It is important to me that the woman I find also share some of those characteristics. I see myself as a professional guy who is competent and knowledgeable about my career while at the same time loves to experience what is really important in life and love.
Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to meeting some one great. After all life is a journey, not a destination, and we all meet people along the way for a purpose. That purpose may not always be clear at first, but everyone you meet has something to teach you about the world, life, themselves and the power that lies within you. Leave me a message and Thanks for reading through.

54,"Dallas, Texas, United States",white,technology,single,"If you are seeking emotional companionship, good communication skills, understanding and support, a joyful time when together, I?€?m capable of that and much more. Chemistry or sensual attraction can be mysterious and unpredictable in my experience. Sensual attraction seems to have her own timing and often appears as needing time to blossom. The movie ?€?Shadow lands?€? about C.S. Lewis is an excellent example of how that works.
If sensual chemistry is not immediately present, I always enjoy an interesting conversation and the opportunity to get to know who you are. What is happening in your world? What do you like and dislike? What experiences have you had that have made you who you are?
I believe friendship comes first, and if a romantic connection is immediately present, what a delicious gift that is. I prefer to be cautious about instant romance, as experience has taught me human feelings can be deceptive and changable. With time, trust develops and then what is real becomes clear.
At this stage in life, I enjoy companionship and personal solitude. As Kahlil Gibran wrote in his masterpiece The Prophet about marriage: ?€?You were born together and together you shall be forever more, but let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of heaven dance between you.?€?
I find that concept ideal for me.
Having made those practical, non romantic statements, I also wish to paradoxically add that I also believe what the Moody Blues sang, ?€?I know you?€?re out there somewhere?€?. So while I am a realist about love and romance, I can be a hopeless romantic if the ?€?goddesses?€? have so decided and cupid?€?s arrow hits my heart. With romantic love present, life takes on a lovely hue. Real love is a rational decision to commit to an imperfect person. This requires time to perfect.
If what I say appeals to you, I would enjoy an e-mail from you (I find ?€?boldness?€? a turn-on). I do not believe the protocol that the male must always be the first to initiate contact. I am not at all shy (the exact opposite is true), so I appreciate a confident woman who knows what she wants and is willing to put herself forward.",1,51-60,United States

Love is a language spoken by everyone, but understood only by a heart, Love is like a river, always changing, but always finding you again somewhere down the road it is the beginning of all the joy which nature has store for us..
When men and women are able to respect and accept their differences then love has a chance to blossom?€?..you can?€?t stop loving or wanting to love because when its right, it?€?s the best thing in the world. When you?€?re in a relationship and it?€?s good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.
I am that guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep?€? wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you?€?re just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you?€?. The one who turns to his friends and says, ?€?that?€?s her.
Friendship isn?€?t about whom you have known the longest?€? It?€?s about who came, and never left your side?€?The words that escape a friend?€?s mouth are ?€?I?€?ll be there when you say you need me?€? but the words that are unheard from a true friend?€?s heart are ?€?I?€?ll be there?€? whether you say you need me or not.
am looking for a special lady that is loving, honest, and loves to have fun. She should be attractive from the inside out, and interested in a fulfilling relationship so we could explore life together.
A woman?€?s laughter is like music! But only if she?€?s laughing with me?€? not at me cos Life is way too short to go through it alone. So here I am, looking for that special relationship. I would describe myself as fun-loving, athletic, intelligent, affectionate and loyal as a puppy dog. so expect many attempts to poke your funny bone.
I enjoy helping others. I treat others the way I would like them to treat me. I love to laugh and be around others who make me laugh. I am looking for someone who also values these traits. I think I am very low maintenance and value that trait in others as well.
I enjoy getting dressed up as much as wearing my oldest blue jeans and white t-shirt. It really does not matter to me what you wear as long as it goes well with your smile. I am down to earth and like relationships that are black and white and based on trust, team work, understanding, and honesty. Honesty is extremely important to me.

57,"Waterlooville, UK",white,technology,divorced,"I'm just a nice normal man looking for a nice normal woman. I?€?m fairly young at heart - I can be playful and silly at times but I also know when to be serious and grown up. I work full time, I can drive and I have a car. I also have a 9 year old daughter who is obviously my main priority. She doesn't live with me but I see her regularly, so if you can't accept this or think it might be a problem then you should look elsewhere. I do still have plenty of free time though!

I like the simple things in life e.g. days out, country/seaside walks, quiet nights in, the odd trip to the cinema etc. In the summer I like to go for rides on my mountain bike when I can. I have social anxiety so I don't really like pubs much unless they're really quiet ones, and definitely not clubs! I'm an animal lover, I have a dry sense of humour and I like a good laugh. I'm a very tactile person and love kissing, cuddling or just holding hands. I'm also polite, courteous and fully house trained, oh, and I always leave the toilet seat down! I'm reliable, honest and trustworthy. My motto in life is treat others as you'd like to be treated yourself.

I?€?m quite a neat and tidy person. One of my pet hates is poor spelling and grammar. I?€?m not really interested in sport. My main hobby is building models - plastic, metal and card.

You'll probably be about my age, although obviously I wouldn?€?t say no to anyone who wasn?€?t if they ticked all the right boxes. I have no problem with age gap relationships, so if you?€?re a lot younger than me then that?€?s fine. If you?€?re child free and you want to get in touch then you must like children, but if you have children already you?€?re also welcome to contact me, particularly if you?€?re a yummy mummy lol.

With any luck you'll be reasonably attractive, with all your own hair and teeth lol, and hopefully agree with most, if not all, of what I?€?ve written about myself above. I'm just looking for a like minded person really. If you like trance music and/or Star Trek/Star Wars too then that would be great! It would be good if you had a car too.",0,51-60,United Kingdom

My friends/coworkers will tell you that I am a shy person. I can be picky but I really believe that love is out of our control. I cannot create a spark or stop a spark. There is either a connection or not. I have met people online or via telephone conversations and they seem great but when we meet there is no chemistry or connection. It is not all about looks especially as we get older but none-the-less there has to be a physical attraction. A personality can make someone cuter or uglier as you get to know them..Profiles help but lack personal interaction and feedback.that can only come through emails if people are honest and the the true test comes at eventual Trusting each other Long profiles are boring and we are too busy to read long drawn out introductions so I will shut up.

Independent: yet caring and an intuitive communicator. Emotionally mature: goal-oriented yet spontaneous, romantic yet realistic.

I have a good sense of humor, love to laugh and like to keep a relationship fun and refreshing. I am intelligent, but also know I am a long way from perfect. I am outgoing and would rather be with that special someone having fun than be inside sleeping in a chair. Discovering new places and learning new things keeps me energized. Laughter is extremely important. The kind that hurts. There is nothing in the world sexier than a woman with a great laugh and sense of humor. I am looking for someone who can laugh at life?€?s daily absurdities and incongruities. I am passionate about music I enjoy going to concerts and love music of all kinds from the blues, zydeco, rock, New Orleans funk, Americana, ska, punk, classic rock, you name it. I?€?m looking for a woman who enjoys an active lifestyle. A woman who can be spontaneous and enjoy it! She is smart, perceptive, and self confident. She is independent, but also very affectionate and sensual. Also playful with a good sense of humor, and loves romance. She doesn?€?t need a man to tell her what to think. But she WANTS a man with a mind of his own, who also wants to know what SHE thinks! If you don?€?t agree with that, then I am probably not the right Guy for you. If you?€?d like more info, please let me know.Talking about who i am, I am that easy going type,open minded and a good listener. I laugh a lot and try to make people around me all the time happy. My hobbies are too many but to mention a few; sports,watching movies, going for walks, listening to all types of music, dancing in the dark etc.My favorite movies are romantic movies, eating habits are just about anything..I think i should let you know that My lips are kissable which is one of my most attractive features,I can kiss my woman for a whole day..Even in Public.Now don?€?t get me wrong I?€?m a very fun person and can make fun of any situation. I?€?m just looking for everything I need in one woman.",1,51-60,United States

Name's David, 26, guitarist for 11 years now. Although I listen to a lot of metal, my primary influences are world renowned masterclass guitarists, most preferred playing style is progressive/instrumental rock. 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and just about any hard rock/metal that came out between '95 and '08 encompasses a lot of my musical tastes. EDM is awesome too.
Looking for someone genuine, honest, caring, someone that has similar interests to mine. I haven't dated in almost a year, so I'm looking to get out there and try it again. And let's just make one thing clear: I am not a sports fan. I do not despise them, but music is my life, my love, my breath, my drug. I do not make time for sports, its just not my thing, so if you're a sports fan it probably won't work out. I seek a music lover.

And, perhaps I should elaborate on some things. I do not want someone who focuses too much on material possessions, or too enveloped with social media or their phone. I do care about what you're wearing, but i care more about whether or not you have a good heart. I want someone who actually cares, someone that gives a crap about being a good human being, that has morals and values, someone selfless, doesn't mind going out of their way for someone else besides themselves here and there. 

I'm looking for someone that enjoys life, likes to go out, get some fresh air, walk and talk, get to know one another, maybe grab a bite to eat or a cup of coffee, gaze into the cosmos at night and just relax for a change. I do not Netflix and chill, movies are a bad first date because you can't have a conversation and get to know one another. 

I'm not going to try to put my arm around you or move in for a kiss, I don't really care for any of that until I get to know you. If we do get to know one another, them absolutely, I'm a total sucker for romance, I love to cuddle, I love kissing, looking into one anothers eyes absolutely and unequivocally transfixed, I love all of that. But above all else, what I'm looking for in a girl the most? Someone who appreciates me for who I am, supports what i do, and the fact that I will go out of my way for someone. If I say I'm going to do something I follow through, I would not be the person I am today if I never stuck to my convictions or kept my word. 

If youve made it this far and I sound like someone you'd like to meet, shoot me a message. Hopefully you're the one :)",0,31-40,United States

Sorry if you don't like it.
I have a concern, men, what's wrong with you? I've been in the program for several months and none of you have firm words, as we say here, a man's word, they ask for sexy photos, pornographic photos, for that there you have clubs, brothels and you can pay for a service complete because in many cases it is legal, if that is what you are looking for, that is not how you conquer a woman! Think about how your parents fell in love before, with a lot of respect, with principles, education with admiration and how those couples lasted and became They loved, I know as the Bible says because the Bible is not wrong that in recent times the love of many would grow cold because of evil and that is what is happening but you as men respect yourselves.
Truly my beautiful men because you are part of our happiness and the opposite also happens.
Be real men when you meet a lady through this program, do not give her false illusions and hopes, we really ask you to think if some of your sons or daughters were going through the same thing, what would you as parents do?
And remember, not all women who sign up for this program are the same, I know that there are good women looking for true love, think about that, think.
